Project title:
VelmotApp

Problem statement:
Users and companies that rely on electric motors, tools, and transformers often lack an easy way to request service, track repair status and communicate with the workshop.  
This leads to time loss, unclear information, and delays in operations.

Target users:
Industrial companies, craftsmen, and private users of electrical tools and devices who use Velmot’s electro-service solutions.

Proposed solution:
Develop a web application for online service requests, real-time repair tracking, and digital management of work orders.
This improves communication between customers and the workshop while speeding up the entire service process.

How you came up with the idea:
The idea came from personal experience and real needs within the Velmot company, which specializes in rewinding electric motors, transformer servicing, tool repair and other.  
Through daily operations, the need for a digital system became clear — one that would simplify service tracking and improve communication with clients.
